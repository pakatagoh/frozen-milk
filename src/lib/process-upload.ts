/**
 * Serialize uploads through a single in-process queue.
 *
 * The old job worker processed one image at a time, which kept Google Sheets
 * row allocation race-free — `appendToSheet` reads the last used row and then
 * writes the next one, so two concurrent appends would both pick the same row
 * and clobber each other. The UI now fires uploads concurrently (so the user
 * can keep snapping), so this queue restores that one-at-a-time guarantee on
 * the server while each client entry still shows its own independent status.
 *
 * NOTE: this only serializes within a single server process. If you ever run
 * multiple replicas, switch `appendToSheet` to the Sheets `values.append` API
 * (atomic end-of-table insert) instead of relying on this queue.
